# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a file system where there's a timeline of current and past and peripheral drafts of something. It is a way of organizing work across people, their computers, and the cloud. 

Version control is useful because one draft of work is fallible, for tons of reasons. Your computer's local draft could "drink your coffee," as said in the video; you could misplace the file; your team could misplace the file; or everything could not work, and you need to revert to an older draft of something. It's **way, way** better than having a flash drive with filenames like "legit" or "latest-version" circulating among a team or indivdual project. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is an experimental, peripheral, or working draft of a project that may be merged with the always-working master branch. A branch is one way of separating users' work on a project and work within a project, like a new feature. 

A branch should be used to work on a new feature. Or, it can an idea you have to change a project but aren't sure whether it will work. You'd use it because it's safer to mess up a branch than the master file which should remain immaculate. You would also use it to work well in a team. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit submits a file that's been added from a local drive. It communicates your changes as well. A good commit message is part of that. 

A good commit message is like a command "Add this ..." or "Fix this ...", as opposed to "Added" or "Fixed". In this way, everyone knows what is happening currently - not the past. Next it should have a specific point or purpose. For instance, "Fix all this stuff" or "Add my latest ;)" are not specific. Instead, "Fix the splash page's graphic filepath" refers to a particular solution. If you actualy "Fix all the stuff" then you should probably have more than one commit message describing each thing you fixed. 

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is the result of differing code in the same places. For instance, it's kind of like Suggesting in google docs for changes. A merge conflict is resolved by a teammate who looks at the differences to figure out what works and what should overwrite the other. 


Oh hey there DBC!!
