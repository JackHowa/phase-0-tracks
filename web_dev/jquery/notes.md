Worked on the 2-hour tutorial on Free Code Camp! 

https://www.freecodecamp.com/

I like how interactive fCC's framework is. There's instant feedback whether you're doing something right. For a small skill, this is really helpful. Really like the site's ui too. 

I've been using pomodoro method. 

## Next Point 

The pomodoro method was really helpful with the browser extension Strict Workflow for Chrome.
