What are some common HTTP status codes?

200s are good. 200 is what you're going for. 400s, especially 404, are bad. 404 is the common fail whale, or file not found.

What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?

GET request is meant to output data from server side data. GET data will be used to pass info to a user, like a photo on CNN. POST request is meant to input data into a server side system. It'd be like an email subscription insert on CNN.

What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?

A cookie is a trace on your machine of a previous visit to website. It allows for websites to determine "unique visitors" who visit or click their page numerous times over one session. 

An HTTP response issues a cookie. Then the HTTP request can grab the cookie to recognize you, or at least your machine, the next time that computer visits the web page.
