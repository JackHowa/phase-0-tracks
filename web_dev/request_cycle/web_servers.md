What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Open source code that can be reused by others. Also, test programs and fail early. Basically make the most basic, simple program you can. Then, update it with other features in separate programs.

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

One advantage is that a user can't cause all servers to malfunction. It's similar to a virtual machine that you can work on separate from your own machine.

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

A root attack seems to be in the news a lot. By acting like a user, rather than a super-user, you minimize risk of ruining something or getting attacked. Plus, by logging in as a root, you won't be able to access all the files, if you accidentally deleted them.
