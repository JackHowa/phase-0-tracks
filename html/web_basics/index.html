<h1>What should I have for more snack?</h1>	

<p>There's <strong>a lot</strong> riding on what I have for a snack ;)</p>
<p>One reason is that I work best when I have food <em>in my belly</em>. And here's 3 more reasons why ...</p>
<ul>
	<li>I can focus not on what I'm going to eat next.</li>
	<li>I can function when I'm looking at food around me.</li>
	<li>I'm able to think about more than one thing at once.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, here's the top 3 choices for what I want to eat next:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Chinese food (maybe <a href ="https://www.pandaexpress.com/">Panda Express</a>?)</li>
  <li>Mac and Cheese</li>
  <li>Salad with chicken</li>
</ol>
